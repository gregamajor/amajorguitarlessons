<p>Most beginner guitar lessons start out with the "A Major Music beginner packet", which is a fun and fast way to learn the foundations of guitar and music. We teach the fundamentals of guitar through 4 popular and fun songs! Then you will be ready to venture off into just about whatever style you are interested in and your instructor can simplify advanced songs to your level.</p>
<p>You can start thinking of about 5 songs you like or would eventually like to learn how to play! It may be a month or two before we get to them but it will give your instructor a good idea of what you would like to learn. Also the songs do not have to have guitar in them (for example: we can play a piano song on the guitar "no problem!"). Even most difficult professional songs we can simplify if needed.

    a month, which is a "discounted monthly rate" based off the regular 30-minute lesson per week schedule. The length and frequency of the lesson may be adjusted upon your request.</p>
    <p>You get a lesson every week of the month and the monthly price is based on 4 lessons a month, but because you will get an extra lesson on the four/five 5-week months each year, you get 4 weeks off each year, one of which is christmas week, a sick day for you and 2 for your instructor, but instructors will make up sick days for new students.</p>
<ul>

    <li>2 Lessons for your teacher to use as sick days / vacation</li>
    <li>1 Lessons for you to use as sick days / vacation</li>
</ul>
    <p>We give a big discount for paying monthly because consistent lessons are more effective, It helps the teachers to keep a weekly schedule and it is great for budgeting.</p>
    <p>Tuition is normally collected on the 5th of each month. We are very flexible and willing to work with you. If we are given a notice, it is almost always totally fine if you need to wait a week or so to your months payment charged.</p>
    <p>Pro-rated tuition is only available to new students in the first month of lessons. For example if you start half way through the month you will only need to pay half of that month. Lessons that fall on holidays can be made-up. Refunds are not available for termination of lessons or absences. However make-up lessons may be available (see section below).</p>
    <h2>Attendance Info</h3>
    <p>Regular attendance is important to the success of the student, so we ask that you make every effort to attend all lessons. If you need to cancel a lesson with your teacher, please contact them directly no later than 24 hours before your scheduled lesson time to be eligible for a make up lesson. </p>
    <p>When going out of town here are some ways we recommend to help stay consistent, get the most out of your lessons, not fall behind and to avoid paying more expensive non-monthly fee.</p>
<ul>
    <li>If you are missing an entire week, we recommend scheduling a double lesson the week before you leave or the week after you return.</li>
    <li>If you are missing two entire weeks, we recommend scheduling a double lesson the week before you leave and for the week after you return.</li>
</ul>
    <h3>Arrival Time</h3>
    <p>For in-home lessons (where the teacher drives to your home for the lesson) the teacher may arrive 15 minutes early or late. For example, if your lesson is scheduled for 5pm plan on your teacher arriving between 4:45pm and 5:15pm.</p>
    <h3>No Shows</h3>
    <p>If a student fails to call to cancel a lesson and does not show up or is not home upon teacher arrival, no make up lesson is required to be given. As well as all missed or canceled make up lessons are not <i>required</i> to be made up, however we almost always give our students make-up lessons because we want you to suceed and get the lessons you wanted. If a lesson is missed without notice due to special circumstances like car accident or an emergency a make up lesson may still be given. </p>
    <h2>Withdrawals and Transfers </h3>
    <p>You may request to be transferred to a different teacher at any time. You may also withdrawal from lessons at any time, however you may lose your lesson time and no refunds are given.</p>
